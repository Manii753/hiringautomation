# Hiring Automation User Guide

Welcome to the Hiring Automation tool! This guide will help you navigate the application, manage candidates, and streamline your hiring workflow using AI-powered evaluations.

## 1. Getting Started

### Login
Access the application through your web browser. You will need to sign in to access the dashboard. If your session expires, you may be prompted to log in again to ensure security.

## 2. Dashboard Navigation

Upon logging in, you will see the **Candidate List** dashboard. This is your central hub for managing interview records.

### Features:
*   **Search:** Use the search bar at the top left to find candidates by name.
*   **Filters:** Use the dropdown buttons to filter the list by:
    *   **Status:** (All, Pending, Pass, Fail)
    *   **Owner:** Filter by the team member who owns the record.
    *   **Position:** Filter by job position.
*   **Date Picker:** Filter candidates by a specific interview date.
*   **Refresh:** Click the refresh icon button to sync the latest data from your files.

### The List View:
The table displays key information:
*   **Name:** Candidate's name (extracted from the file name).
*   **Interview Date:** Date the interview took place.
*   **Owner:** The team member associated with the file.
*   **Position:** The job role detected from the file name.
*   **Status:** Current status of the application (Pending, Pass, Fail).
*   **Actions:** Click "View Details" to open the candidate's full profile and evaluation page.

## 3. Managing Jobs

Before evaluating candidates, ensure the relevant Job roles are set up in the system. This allows the AI to generate relevant summaries and links candidates to the correct tasks in ClickUp.

1.  Navigate to the **Jobs** page (usually accessible via the navigation menu or URL `/jobs`).
2.  **Create a New Job:**
    *   Click the "Create New Job" button.
    *   **Job Name:** Enter the title (e.g., "Senior Developer").
    *   **ClickUp Task ID:** Enter the specific ID for the task in ClickUp to link them.
    *   **Slack Mentions:** Add usernames to be mentioned in Slack notifications.
    *   **Prompt:** (Optional) Customize the specific instructions for the AI when generating summaries for this role.
3.  **Edit/Delete:** Use the pencil or trash icon on existing job cards to update details or remove a job.

## 4. Candidate Evaluation Workflow

Clicking "View Details" on a candidate takes you to their evaluation page. Follow this flow to process a candidate:

### Step 1: Review Candidate Details
*   **Header Info:** View the candidate's name, email, and interview timestamp.
*   **Recording:** Click the "Interview Recording" link to watch/listen to the interview.
*   **Manatal Profile:** The system automatically checks for a matching profile in Manatal. If found, details like current position and a link to their resume will appear on the right.
*   **Job Association:** Ensure the correct Job is selected in the dropdown on the right. If missing, select the appropriate role you created in the "Jobs" section.

### Step 2: Analyze Transcript
*   **Interview Notes & Transcript:** Read the full transcript of the interview in the main central card. You can expand this view for easier reading.

### Step 3: Manager Decision
*   **Manager Review:** Enter your personal comments or observations in the text area.
*   **Pass/Fail:** Click the **Pass** or **Fail** button based on your decision.
    *   *Note: This action triggers the automated AI evaluation process via n8n.*

### Step 4: AI Evaluation & Sharing
Once you click Pass or Fail, the system sends the data to the background workflow (n8n) and waits for a response.

1.  **AI Summary:** An "AI Evaluation Summary" section will appear, populated with insights generated by the system.
2.  **Edit (Optional):** If you need to refine the AI's output, click the **Pencil icon** to edit the text fields directly. Save your changes.
3.  **Re-evaluate:** If needed, you can click "Re-evaluate" to reset the status and generate a new summary (warning: this overwrites the current one).
4.  **Send Notes:** Click the **Send Notes** button to finalize the process. This will:
    *   Post the evaluation summary and your comments to the configured **Slack channel**.
    *   Tag the relevant team members defined in the Job settings.

## 5. How n8n Automation Works

This application relies on **n8n** (a workflow automation tool) to handle the "heavy lifting" behind the scenes. You don't need to interact with n8n directly, but it helps to know what it does:

1.  **Trigger:** When you click "Pass" or "Fail", the application sends the candidate's transcript, your comments, and the job details to n8n.
2.  **Processing:** n8n processes this text using AI models to generate a structured summary, pros/cons, and other evaluation metrics based on the Job's custom prompt.
3.  **Response:** n8n sends this generated information back to the application, which then displays it in the "AI Evaluation Summary" section for you to review.
